# CS221-Projects
Quick Assignments for my Data Structures Course
-> the Major difference between the projects is the 
    driver and the Player List ADT
    
Program 1: basic dynamic array [not added b/c boring]

Program 2: Singly Linked List w/o remove

Program 3: Doubly Linked list with overloaded operators

Program 4: Binary Search Tree

Program 5: Array with a questionable implementation of merge sort
